~~## Brave~~

~~Since 0.55, Brave [has moved to another repository](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser) and the offline installer is not available on the releases page.~~

## Oracle JDK

Oracle JDK cannot be downloaded programmatically.

## KiTTY

Available through third party websites without direct download.

## Twitch

Available as setup but cannot be processed because the executable uses a non-extractable InstallShield setup (and cannot be decompressed because of the UPX format used).
